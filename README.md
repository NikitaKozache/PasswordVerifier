<h1 align="center">Authentication System Simulation</h1>

<p>In the event of a password matching the predefined values in the program, the program should grant access. In case of an error, it should display an error message and request re-entry. After 3 failed attempts, the program should display a message about an unauthorized access attempt and terminate its operation. (To simplify the code representation, use an integer variable.)
Task of increased complexity: Enhance the program by including a user database (login and password) and requiring not only the password entry but also the corresponding username.</p>
